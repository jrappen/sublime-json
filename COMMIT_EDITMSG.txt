[JSON] Rewrite syntax


- Using inheritance split up `JSON.sublime-syntax` into:
    - `JSON.sublime-syntax` with `scope:source.json`
    - `GeoJSON.sublime-syntax` with `scope:source.json.geojson`
    - `JSONdotNET.sublime-syntax` with `scope:source.json.jsondotnet`
    - `JSONC.sublime-syntax` with `scope:source.json.jsonc`
    - `HJSON.sublime-syntax` with `scope:source.json.hjson`
    - `JSON5.sublime-syntax` with `scope:source.json.json5`
- Add many more file extensions for `JSON` & `JSONC`:
    - add doc links to extensions where applicable as a reference to be
      able to more quickly verify that they (still) use said syntax
      flavor


Syntax changes:

- Numbers:
    - Correctly scope number signs with `constant.numeric.sign` instead
      of `keyword.operator.arithmetic`
    - Significantly improve number highlighting (thanks to deathaxe)
      to catch more typos while typing and mark illegal formatting as
      such
    - highlight the following as invalid:
        - numeric sign of explicitly positive numbers (for JSON,
          JSON.NET & JSONC)
        - whitespace between numeric sign and numeric value in numbers
        - leading decimal separators in numbers (for JSON, JSON.NET &
          JSONC)
        - trailing decimal separators in numbers (for JSON, JSON.NET &
          JSONC)
        - leading zeros in numbers
- Objects:
    - Highlighting speed improvements for empty objects (thanks to
      FichteFoll)
    - Make `mapping.*` contexts more modular
- Arrays:
    - Highlighting speed improvements for empty arrays (thanks to
      FichteFoll)


Metadata changes:

- Completions:
    - completions have been added for language constants, including kind
      info and details (with links to docs)
        - `null`, `false`, `true` for JSON
        - `Infinity` and `NaN` for JSON5
- Settings:
    - a `default_extension` is now set for all JSON flavors
- Symbol index:
    - with an object structure at the top-level, only top-level keys
      within now show up in the index (including tests for symbols and
      syntax)
- Tests:
    - test files now test the base scope
    - Significantly extend tests to cover more parts of the syntaxes
    - Split original test file into logical parts
    - Add indentation tests for:
        - `json`, `json5` & `jsonc`
        - `mapping` (objects), `sequence` (arrays)
    - Add symbols tests for:
        - top-level keys of object structures (thanks to deathaxe)
        - languages: `json`, `jsonc` & `json5`
    - Fix tests for `meta.mapping meta.mapping.*`


Language specific changes:

- JSON:
    - Make use of newer syntax features including those only available
      in `version: 2` syntaxes
    - Make use of `variables` (with optimizations provided by deathaxe
      and regex patterns provided by Thomas Smith)
    - Context names now more closely match the naming scheme of other
      (recently re-written) default syntaxes
    - (correctly formatted) JSON code can now be prettified or minified
      via the context menu or the command palette. JSON code can
      optionally be auto-prettified on pre save events.
    - highlight the following as invalid:
        - leading commas
        - trailing commas
        - multiple commas
    - only allow exactly one structure (object, array) or value
      (constant, number, string) at top level (thanks to Keith Hall)
- JSON.NET:
    - support requested by Keith Hall,
      built with feedback from Michael B. Lyons
- JSONC:
    - highlight some files by default as `JSONC` (as decided by
      Jon Skinner in sublimehq/Packages#285)
    - highlight leading & multiple commas as invalid, trailing as valid
    - scope empty block comments as such
    - support syntax based folding of ST4131+,
      compare sublimehq/Packages#3291
- HJSON:
    - single quoted strings
    - thrice single quoted multiline strings
    - line comments with hashes
- JSON5:
    - explicitly pos numbers, hexadecimal ints, Infinity and NaN
    - single quoted strings
    - more escape chars for strings
    - ECMA identifierName as object keys (regexes thanks to Thomas
      Smith)
        - scoped as plain unquoted strings (thanks to Thomas Smith)
        - support string interpolation (thanks to deathaxe)
    - line continuation in strings (with tests thanks to Keith Hall)
    - highlight the following as invalid:
        - multiple commas


Changes to other languages:

- Leave `JSON` headers in `Markdown` as `json` only, but split up fenced
  code blocks into `json`, `json5` & `jsonc` to behave similarly to
  `GitHub Flavored Markdown`

BREAKING CHANGES:

- JSON does not have values that can be set via an inline calculation
  with the help of operators, but only simple number values. Scopes for
  number signs have changed from being `keyword.operator.arithmetic` to
  `constant.numeric.sign`. Color scheme authors should add this, should
  it be missing.
- The `JSON.sublime-syntax` now marks comments as `invalid`, third party
  plugin authors should instead target `JSONC.sublime-syntax` to keep
  the user experience as-is.
- Only top-level keys in JSON files containing a single object structure are
  indexed symbols. Color scheme authors should add special highlighting to
  differentiate them from other keys. Compare the `Symbol List` metadata file.
