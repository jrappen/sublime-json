[JSON] Rewrite syntax


- Using inheritance split up `JSON.sublime-syntax` into:
    - `JSON (Basic).sublime-syntax` with `scope:source.json.basic`
    - `JSON.sublime-syntax` with `scope:source.json`
    - `JSONC.sublime-syntax` with `scope:source.json.jsonc`
    - `JSON5.sublime-syntax` with `scope:source.json.json5`
- Add many more file extensions for `JSON` & `JSONC`:
    - add doc links to extensions where applicable as a reference to be
      able to more quickly verify that they (still) use said syntax
      flavor
- JSON:
    - highlight leading / trailing / multiple commas as invalid
- JSONC:
    - highlight leading / multiple commas as invalid, trailing as valid
- Add JSON5 with support for:
    - explicitly pos numbers, hexadecimal ints, Infinity and NaN
    - single quoted strings
    - more escape chars for strings
    - ECMA identifierName as object keys (re-using regexes from the JavaScript
      syntax by @Thom1729)
- Objects
    - Add `meta.toc-list` scope to top level object keys to add them to the
      symbol list (also add tests, see below)
    - Highlighting speed improvements for empty objects
    - Make `mapping.*` contexts more modular
- Arrays
    - Highlighting speed improvements for empty arrays
- Numbers
    - Significantly improve number highlighting
- Syntaxes
    - Make use of newer syntax features including those only available in
      `version: 2` syntaxes
    - Make use of `variables`
- Tests
    - Significantly extend tests to cover more parts of the syntaxes defined.
    - Split original test file into logical parts
    - Add indentation tests for:
        - `json`, `jsonc` & `json5`
        - `mapping` (objects), `sequence` (arrays)
    - Add symbols tests for:
        - scope: `meta.toc-list.json | meta.toc-list.json5`
        - languages: `json`, `jsonc` & `json5`
    - Fix tests for `meta.mapping meta.mapping.*`
- Leave `JSON` headers in `Markdown` as `json` only, but split up fenced
  code blocks into `json`, `jsonc` & `json5` to behave similarly to
  `GitHub Flavored Markdown`

- address #757 using tips to fix line comments for `JSONC`
- address #2430 using sort-order as requested by deathaxe
- address #2852 using tips to fix scopes of curly braces & square
  brackets in `JSON`
