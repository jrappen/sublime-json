[JSON] Rewrite syntax


- Using inheritance split up `JSON.sublime-syntax` into:
    - `JSON (Basic).sublime-syntax` with `scope:source.json.basic`
    - `JSON.sublime-syntax` with `scope:source.json`
    - `JSONC.sublime-syntax` with `scope:source.json.jsonc`
    - `JSON5.sublime-syntax` with `scope:source.json.json5`
- Add many more file extensions for `JSON` & `JSONC`:
    - add doc links to exensions where applicable as a reference to be
      able to more quickly verify that they (still) use said syntax
      flavor
- Only allow objects or arrays at the top level
    - add `meta.toc-list` scope to top level object keys to add them to
      the symbol list (also add tests, see below)
- Make use of newer syntax features including those only available in
  `version: 2` syntaxes
- Make use of `variables`
- Highlighting speed improvements for empty objects and empty arrays
- Significantly improve number highlighting
- Correctly scope number signs with `constant.numeric.sign` instead of
  `keyword.operator.arithmetic`
- Significantly extend tests to cover more parts of the syntaxes
  defined:
    - Split original test file into logical parts
    - Add indentation tests for:
        - `json`, `jsonc` & `json5`
        - `mapping` (objects), `sequence` (arrays)
    - Add symbols tests for:
        - scope: `meta.toc-list.json | meta.toc-list.json5`
        - languages: `json`, `jsonc` & `json5`
- Fix tests for `meta.mapping meta.mapping.*`
- Make `mapping.*` contexts more modular
- Leave `JSON` headers in `Markdown` as `json` only, but split up fenced
  code blocks into `json`, `jsonc` & `json5` to behave similarly to
  `GitHub Flavored Markdown`


BREAKING CHANGE: number signs scopes have changed

- scopes for number signs have changed from being
  `keyword.operator.arithmetic` to `constant.numeric.sign`


- fix #285 as requested by Jon
- address #757 using tips to fix line comments for `JSONC`
- address #2430 using sort-order as requested by deathaxe
- address #2852 using tips to fix scopes of curly braces & square
  brackets in `JSON`
